This is the method to get all workouts posted by everybody on the application without limit to the user that created them.
This is an implementation for something like when you are on the homepage of twitter, etc. You get to see not just your posts but other people's posts too.

//get all workouts
const getWorkouts = async (req, res) => {
  const workouts = await Workout.find({}).sort({ createdAt: -1 });

  res.status(200).json(workouts);
};

This is the method to fet all workouts posted by a particular user.
This is similar to view all our posts on our profile on twitter, facebook, etc.
const getWorkouts = async (req, res) => {
  const user_id = req.user._id;

  const workouts = await Workout.find({ user_id }).sort({ createdAt: -1 });

  res.status(200).json(workouts);
};
